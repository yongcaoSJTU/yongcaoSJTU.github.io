Yong Cao is an Associate Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, specializing in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to fluid mechanics, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and wind engineering & energy. My research focuses on the wind resistance of structures and cities during extreme climate events, such as typhoons, as well as wind energy prediction and utilization in both marine and terrain environments, all with the goal of contributing to a sustainable society.

I am also open to and actively seek international collaborations to further expand the impact of my research and to address global challenges in the fields of energy and climate resilience.

[**Introduction**]
- This study proposes a novel super-resolution (or SR) framework for generating high-resolution turbulent boundary layer (TBL) flow from low-resolution inputs. The framework combines a super-resolution generative adversarial neural network (SRGAN) with down-sampling modules (DMs), integrating the residual of the continuity equation into the loss function. The framework iteratively applies the SRGAN and DM procedure to fully capture the energy cascade of multi-scale flow structures, collectively termed the SRGAN-based energy cascade reconstruction framework (EC-SRGAN). Despite being trained solely on turbulent channel flow data (via zero-shot transfer), EC-SRGAN exhibits remarkable generalization in predicting TBL small-scale velocity fields.

**Yong Cao**, Tetsuro Tamura

[**Introduction**]
- Large-eddy simulations were used to investigate unsteady flows around a wall-mounted hemisphere as the Reynolds number (Re, based on the diameter of the hemisphere D) increased from 7√ó10^4 to 7√ó10^5. Strong Re dependence was found to be present even for the flow around a wall-mounted obstacle after systematic examination of aerodynamic forces, local pressures, and flow structures.
